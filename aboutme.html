    <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In my professional life I am working toward getting scholarships for collage and learning more about careers that might interest me in the future. In my personal life I am working on becoming a person more devoted to God and becoming a better softball player and athlete in general. Some experiences that led me here are how I interact with my teammates and peers by going through the ups and downs of being a team. As while as teachers and adults who have helped to guide me through hard classes and hard times at school and in sports. 
I am working toward these goals by working hard at school, doing research about college, and practicing skills for my sport, college, and career. 
Some values that I consider most necessary for my success are teamwork, leadership, devotion, passion, discipline, integrity, and responsibility. 
Some short-term goals that I hope to accomplish in the near future are to get straight A's, pass my EOC's and AP exam and make the high school softball team.
The character traits and achievements that I want to be known for are being responsible, honest, kind, caring, a good teammate and peer, and hard-working. </p>
